                      <p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, I was completely shocked when I got to know that I’ve won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It was the second time when I participated in debate competition. At the time when I participated for the very first time so I didn’t secure any position in this competition, At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I’d do more hard work and I will participate again and I guess that I took the right decision to participate again, Also I learnt that hard work always pays off because At my first participation, I was not concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and because of that I have gotten this prize, My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and now I have known that hard work is most important to achieve success.</p>

                                  <p>Today was a science exhibition in my school. I have also taken part in the exhibition. My group had made a model of the greenhouse effect for the exhibition. We have practiced and given a lot of efforts for the exhibition. When the judges came to our model, they were very happy to see our efforts. They asked many questions related to our model. All the four of us gave the answers with confidence and serenity. At the end of the day when the results were out, we stood second in the competition.</p>
